# Flash Cards

### Description:
Need a new way to study your JavaScript iterators? You're in luck, "Flash Cards" is the app you're looking for!  You are able to study a set of 30 multiple choice questions specific to JS iterators, and at the end of the deck or the game, you will be given a percentage of correct answers to keep a tab on your development in the subject!

### Installation Instructions:
    - Fork this repository
    - Clone down your new, forked repo
    - cd into the repository
    - Open it in your text editor

#### To view your project:

### Context:
This app is a our first solo project of Mod 2. We were given 4 days to complete the entire project. I was able to finish the project on day 3. I created all of the tests before creating code in our .js files.  This was my first experience writing tests before my code! It was a super fun experience and very rewarding when you are able to see you logic at work!


### Future Features:
Given the opportunity to better this application, I would add a timer to test the user's timing with the knowledge. I would add the feature to restart the game if the percentage of correct answers are too low!
